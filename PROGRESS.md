# Wedding Website - Chakra UI Setup Progress

## Summary of Work Completed

### Initial State
- Wedding website built with Next.js and Chakra UI v3
- Custom theme system created with wedding colors (soft pink, warm gold, sage green, cream)
- Navigation bar rendering but with layout issues

### Issues Identified
1. **ChakraProvider Configuration**: The layout was using the default ChakraProvider instead of the custom Provider component
2. **Navigation Bar**: Not properly centered and logo needs correction
3. **MCP Integration**: User wanted to utilize Chakra UI MCP but no MCP servers are currently configured

### Actions Taken

#### 1. Fixed ChakraProvider Setup âœ…
- Updated `/src/app/layout.tsx` to import and use the custom `Provider` component
- This ensures the custom wedding theme (colors, fonts, glass morphism effects) is properly applied

#### 2. Navigation Bar Issues (In Progress)
- Identified the navigation component structure in `/src/app/page.tsx`
- Current implementation uses:
  - Fixed positioning with glass morphism effect
  - Logo on the left: "Shivani & Saurav"
  - Navigation items on the right (hidden on mobile)
  
### Current Status

#### Completed Tasks
- [x] Fix ChakraProvider setup to use custom theme system
- [x] Verify Chakra UI components are rendering correctly

#### In Progress
- [ ] Fix navigation bar centering
- [ ] Fix logo in navigation

#### Pending
- [ ] Test the navigation with proper theme configuration
- [ ] Set up Chakra UI MCP integration (blocked - no MCP servers configured)

### Next Steps
1. Update the navigation component to properly center content
2. Fix logo alignment and styling
3. Ensure responsive behavior works correctly
4. Consider setting up MCP servers if needed for enhanced Chakra UI features

### Technical Details

#### Theme System (`/src/theme/system.ts`)
- Custom wedding color palette defined
- Glass morphism effects configured
- Semantic tokens for consistent styling

#### Provider Setup (`/src/components/ui/provider.tsx`)
- Wraps ChakraProvider with custom theme system
- Used in the root layout for global theme application

#### Navigation Structure
- Uses Chakra UI Box, Container, Flex components
- Glass card effect with backdrop blur
- Responsive design with mobile menu (currently being implemented)
